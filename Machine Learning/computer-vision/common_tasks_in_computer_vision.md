# Computer Vision

The ability for computers to interpret and understand the content and context of images.

- **Discriminative Models**: Focus on assigning labels or scores to images.

  - Includes tasks like:

    - **Classification**: Assigns a global label to the image. Requires textual labels.
    - **Detection**: Identifies and labels specific objects within an image. Requires bounding box annotations.
    - **Segmentation**: Divides the image into distinct regions at the pixel level. Requires detailed pixel-level mask annotations, which can be expensive and time-consuming.

- **Generative Models**: Involves creating images from a given prompt or input.

  - These models learn probability distributions and aim to generate realistic images, often starting from random noise.
