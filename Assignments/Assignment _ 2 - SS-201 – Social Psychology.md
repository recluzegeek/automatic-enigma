## Aggression
Any form of behaviour directed towards the goal of harming or injuring another living being who is motivated to avoid such treatment. 
-	Aggressive behaviour is defined by its underlying motivation (to harm or injure another) not by its consequences (whether or not harm or injury actually occurs)
	-	A **shot fired from a gun** may miss its target, but if the shot was intended to hit the target, it is nonetheless an **instance of aggression**. On the other hand, your **dentist may cause you pain**, but it is incidental or accidental, and not intended, hence it is **not aggression**.

## Types of Aggression
The two types of aggression differ with respect to the underlying motivation of the actor, which are explained below:
### 1. Instrumental Aggression
- Aggressive behaviour performed to **reach a particular goal**, as a means to an end.
	- People carry out acts of instrumental aggression for purpose of achieving a particular goal, such as **taking a hostage in order to secure a ransom.** Here, the behaviour is driven by the ultimate goal the actor wants to achieve (obtaining a large sum of money), and aggression is selected as one of several possible means towards reaching that end.
### 2 . Hostile Aggression
-	Aggressive behaviour **motivated by the desire to express anger and hostile feelings**.
	-	**Bullying, gossiping**, and playing off friends are common examples of this phenomenon.

## Influences on Aggression
- There are several factors that can influence aggression in individuals. Some of these factors include:
	- **Biological factors:** Biological factors such as genetics, hormones, and brain chemistry can all play a role in aggression. For example, high levels of testosterone have been linked to aggressive behavior.
	- **Environmental Factors:** Environmental factors can also influence aggression, including exposure to violence in the media, living in an unsafe neighbourhood, and experiencing abuse or neglect.
	- **Social factors:** Social factors such as social learning, peer pressure, and cultural norms can also influence aggression. For example, if someone grows up in a culture where aggression is seen as a way to solve problems, they may be more likely to be aggressive themselves.
	- **Psychological factors:** Psychological factors such as stress, frustration, and anger can also lead to aggressive behavior.
	- **Situational factors:** Situational factors such as provocation, alcohol or drug use, and the presence of weapons can increase the likelihood of aggression.

## Steps to Reduce Aggression and Violence
- Reducing aggression and violence is an important goal for individuals, communities, and societies as a whole. Here are some steps that can help reduce aggression and violence:
	- **Social support:** Providing social support to individuals who are at risk of aggression or violence can help them cope with stress and reduce the likelihood of violent behavior.
	- **Conflict resolution:** Encouraging nonviolent methods of conflict resolution such as negotiation, mediation, and arbitration can reduce the likelihood of violence.
	- **Promoting self-control:** Self-control is an important factor in reducing aggression and violence. Strategies such as teaching individuals self-regulation techniques, promoting mindfulness, and providing opportunities for exercise and physical activity can help promote self-control.
	- **Social and Cultural Change:** Addressing cultural and societal factors that contribute to aggression, such as sexism and racism, can help reduce aggression and violence in society.
	- **Education:** Educating individuals about the negative consequences of aggressive behaviour and teaching them effective conflict resolution skills can help reduce aggression.
