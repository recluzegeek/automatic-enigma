# 1. Relational Operators
## a. > (greater then)
## b. < (less then)
## c. >= (greater then or equal to)
## d. <= (less then or equal to)
## e. == (comparison / equals to)
## f. = (assignment operator)
## f. != (not equals operator)


# 2. Boolean Operators
## a. and operator(both argument should be true to make the whole statement true)
- written as ==**"and"**== as opposed to ==**"&&"**== of JAVA syntax.	
## b. or operator(either one of the argument should be true to make the whole statement true)
- written as ==**"or"**== as opposed to ==**"||"**== of JAVA syntax.
## Code Example
```python

(7 > 5) and (5 < 7)	# true
(7 > 5) and (5 > 7)	# false
(7 > 5) or (5 < 7)	# true, as or operator is used
(7 < 5) or (5 > 7)	# false, as both argumnets are false


```
