## 1\. Variables

- Variables are placeholders for the information

```python
#!/bin/python3

#Variables.py

quote = "All is fair in love and programming"
print(quote)
```

## 2\. Methods
- Methods are basically built-in functions for a given object

- ==**Methods are functions that are available for a given object**==

```python
#!/bin/python3

#Variables.py

quote = "All is fair in love and programming"
print(quote)	#prints quote to console
print(quote.upper())	#uppercase
print(quote.lower())	#lowercase
print(quote.title())	#prints title-case version of variable quote
print(len(quote))	#prints the length of characters in quote variable


name = "Salman"		#String
age = 20		#int
gpa = 3.85		#float

print(int(age))		#prints int value of age variable. ! prints 20 to the console
print(int(gpa))		#prints floor value of the float variable. ! prints 3 to the console
print(float(gpa)) #prints float value of gpa variable. ! prints 3.85 to the console

#python can't concatenate int to string as opposed to JAVA. So, we've to convert
# int to string mannualy by calling str() method. JAVA would do that for us. 
# Missing JAVAðŸ˜¥ðŸ˜–ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜¢

print("My name is " + name + " and I'm " + str(age) + " years old")
```

## 3. Function Body Structure
- ==**Mini Programs, Organized block of code and can make  unlimited number of calls to it.**==
- ==**Methods in Python** can usuallly be interchanged with **Functions**==
- ==**Indentation plays an important role in python**==
- ==**Scoping is usually defined using indentation in python**==
```python

def <func-name>(params):
	# example
	# def multiply(x,y):
	#		return x * y
	
```
