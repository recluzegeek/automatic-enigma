- ==**Python has a built in Math Interpreter**==
- ==**Do Maths on the fly with Python**==

## 2.1 Basic Operations

- Python supports addition, subtraction, multiplication and division out of the box.
- ==**Python performs Double Division instead of Integer/Double as JAVA does.**==

```
#!/bin/python3

#Maths.py

print(50 + 50) #addition
print(50 - 50) #subtraction
print(50 * 50) #multiplication
print(50 / 50) #division - this would return us 1.0
print(50 // 6) #division with no leftover ****
print(50 % 6) #modulus - returns 2 as remainder
print(50 ** 50) #exponents - 50 to 50th power
print(50 + 50 - 50 * 50 / 50) #BODMAS
