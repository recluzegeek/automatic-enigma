## 1. Conditional Statements
- ==**Same conditional structures as of JAVA**==
- ==**else if()**== in python is written as ==**elif:**==

```python
# Program # 1
def buyDrink(money):
			if(money >= 2):
				return "You've got yourself a drink!"
			else:
				return "NO drink for you!"
			
# Method Calls
# print(buyDrink(3))	// if-part will be returned
# print(buyDrink(1))	// else-part will be returned
			
```

```
# Program # 2

def cigars(age, money):
		if(age >= 21) and (money >= 5):
			return "Enjoy your cigar!"
		elif(age >= 21) and (money < 5):
			return "Come back with more money"
		elif(age < 21) and (money >=5)
			return "Nice try, Kid!"
		else:
			return "You're too young and poor to buy a cigar."
	

```
