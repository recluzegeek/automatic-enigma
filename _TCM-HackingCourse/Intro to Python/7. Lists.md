## 1. List - A Data Structure
-	==**Python List syntax replicates the array syntax of JAVA.**==
	-	Getting element from a python's list has same syntax as of getting element from a JAVA array.
		-	movies[1] will return the movie stored on index 1
- List is a group of elements,
	- everything inside a list is called an ==**item.**==
- **As Strings have quotes around them, a List have square brackets [ ] around them**
- ==**Python uses the same indexing method as of JAVA. e.g. index starts from 0, not from 1.**==

```python
# Program # 1

# creating a vowels list 
vowels = ["a", "e", "i", "o", "u"]
# to extract and print the second element
print(vowels[1]) # prints "e" to the console
```

## 1.1 Extracting Multiple Items from List
- To extract a group of elements from the list
	- ==**"insert an interval by slicing"**==
		```ruby
		vowels[start:to/end]	# end is not included 
		```
### 1.1.1 Sample Code

```python
# Program # 2

# creating a vowels list
vowels = ["a", "e", "i", "o", "u"]

print(vowels[1]) # prints second element

# start is included in the sliced interval
# but end is not included in the interval
print(vowels[1:3]) # prints "e" and "i" to console

# prints vowels starting from second element till 
# the last element
print(vowels[1:]) 
	
# prints element starting from the beginnig till the
# end - 1 (printing just the first element only) 
print(vowels[:1])

# grab the last item from the list
print(vowels[-1])

# printing reverse
print(vowels[-1:-1])

# printing length of the list
print(len(vowels))	# prints 5 to the consolse

# adding to the list
vowels.append("z")
print(vowels)	# should see "z" at the end of the list

# deleting last item from the list
vowels.pop()
print(vowels)	# z(last item) shouldn't be there

# deleting item from an index of the list
vowels.pop(1)
print(vowels)
