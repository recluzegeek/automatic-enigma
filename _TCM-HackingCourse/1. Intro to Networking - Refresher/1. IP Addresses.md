# What is IP?
-	**IP Addresses are layer 3 protocols** and layer 3 Protocol is a router. **So, when we route traffic, we route via an IP address**.
-   IP basically stands for Internet Protocol. Every device in the network has a unique IP Address and each device is identified by its unique IP address. 
- IP has two different versions/notations, one is **IPV4** which is in **Decimal** and **IPV6** uses **Hex**.
Most commonly used is **IPV4** but **IPV6** is in progress of being acceptable to the society.
