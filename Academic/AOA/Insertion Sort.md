## Insertion Sort - Imp
- For sorted data
	- In an array, we don't have to find out the element.
		- Simply we start shifting elements onto the right, if an element is found smaller than we place it to free space - O(n)
	- But in linked list, we've to found out its position and adjust the pointers - O()
