## Formal Language
- Pre-defined set of symbols and strings
- Studies syntactical aspects of a language
## Alphabet
- Basic element of Formal language
- Finite non-empty set of symbols (letters), denoted by greek symbol sigma - **Σ**
- Σ = {1, 3, 5}, Σ = {0, 1} or Σ={i, j, k}
	### Defining Alphabets - Guidelines
	Alphabets are the basic building blocks for any language
	- Should not contain null/empty string or Λ symbol
	- Should be finite. The number of symbols are finite
	- Should not be ambiguous
## Strings / Construct
- Symbols in alphabets combine to form strings
- Σ = {0,1} then 01, 001, 0110110 are strings 
- Σ = {a,b,c} then a, bc, c, babbbabbab,...
	### Empty / Null String
	- String with no symbol is empty/null string
	- Represented by greek letter lambda Λ(capital) or λ(small)
	- Not included in any of alphabets or in Σ
## Words
- Words are Strings that belong to some specific language
- All words are Strings, but the other way isn't always true
## Ambiguity Rule
- Alphabets should be defined in a way that a letter containing more than one symbol should not start with a symbol, already being used by some other letter
- i.e. one letter should not be the prefix of another. However, a letter may be ended in a letter of same alphabet
## Length of Strings
- Number of letter/symbols used in the String, represented by |s|
- Σ = {a,b}, s = aaabb and |s| = 5
- Σ - {A, aA, bab, d}, s = AaAbabAd
	- Factoring/Tokenization = (A), (aA), (bab), (A), (d)
	- |s| = 5
	- aA has length of 1 not 2
